# Project Name

A Simple Rust Game

## Overview


This project is a simple game developed using the Rust programming language. The game allows the player to control a square on the screen, rotate it, and shoot bullets at enemy squares. The objective is to destroy as many enemies as possible while avoiding collisions.

The purpose of this software is to explore the Rust language and gain hands-on experience with its syntax, concepts, and features. By implementing a game, I aimed to apply various programming techniques and showcase my understanding of Rust's fundamental concepts, such as structs, methods, loops, conditionals, and libraries.

## Demo

Check out the ![software demo video]([(https://youtu.be/5vToeLVsDx4)]) for a 1 minute demonstration of the software running.

## Development Environment

The software was developed using the following tools:

- Rust programming language
- Visual Studio Code as the code editor
- Cargo as the package manager and build tool

## Useful Websites

During the development process, the following websites were helpful:

- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) - Official documentation for the Rust programming language.
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) - A comprehensive resource for learning Rust, including tutorials, guides, and examples.

## Future Work

There are several areas for future improvement and expansion:

- Implement a scoring system and game over condition.
- Add visual effects and animations to enhance the gameplay experience.
- Introduce different types of enemies with varying behaviors and difficulty levels.
- Include sound effects and background music.
- Implement power-ups or special abilities for the player.
- Optimize performance and memory usage.
- Refactor the code to improve readability, modularity, and maintainability.
- Conduct further testing and bug fixing.

By addressing these aspects, the game can be further enhanced and polished, providing a more enjoyable and immersive gaming experience.
